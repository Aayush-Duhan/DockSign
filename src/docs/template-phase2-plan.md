# DockSign Template Feature - Phase 2 Plan

## Overview

Phase 2 of the DockSign template feature builds upon the foundation established in Phase 1, introducing more advanced capabilities for template creation, management, and usage. This phase focuses on enhancing the template system with advanced field types, categorization, granular permissions, version control, and improved user experience.

## Timeline

Estimated duration: **4-6 weeks**

## Key Features

### 1. Advanced Field Types

Expand the template system with more sophisticated field types for advanced document workflows.

**Implementation Details:**
- Add support for:
  - Dropdown menus with customizable options
  - Radio button groups
  - Image placeholders
  - Calculated fields with formula support
  - Table fields with multiple rows/columns
  - Rich text fields with formatting
- Enhance field configuration options:
  - Conditional visibility
  - Advanced validation rules
  - Default values and calculations
  - Formatting options

**Technical Considerations:**
- Update `TemplateField` interface with new field types and configuration options
- Create UI components for each new field type
- Enhance document generation to process advanced field types
- Add field validation for new types

### 2. Template Categories

Implement a categorization system to help users organize and discover templates more effectively.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create category data model:
  - Name, description, color
  - Support for nested categories (optional)
- Add category management:
  - CRUD operations for categories
  - Assign templates to categories
  - Filter and sort templates by category
- Update UI to display categories:
  - Category badges on templates
  - Category filter in template listing
  - Category selection during template creation/edit

**Technical Considerations:**
- Create new `Category` model in the database
- Add category references to `Template` model
- Implement category API endpoints
- Add UI components for category management

### 3. Enhanced Permissions

Develop more granular permission controls for templates to support team collaboration.

**Implementation Details:**
- Create permission levels:
  - View only
  - Use (create documents from)
  - Edit
  - Manage (change permissions)
  - Admin (full control)
- Support sharing with:
  - Individual users
  - Teams/groups
  - Organization-wide permissions
- Implement permission management UI:
  - User/team selection
  - Permission assignment
  - Audit logs for permission changes

**Technical Considerations:**
- Create `TemplatePermission` model linking templates, users/teams, and permission levels
- Enhance permission checking in all template APIs
- Create UI for managing template permissions
- Implement efficient permission querying

### 4. Template Versioning

Add version control for templates to track changes and enable rollbacks.

**Implementation Details:**
- Track template versions:
  - Store version history with timestamps and authors
  - Track field changes between versions
  - Support for version comments/descriptions
- Implement version management:
  - View version history
  - Compare versions
  - Restore previous versions
- Add version controls to UI:
  - Version listing
  - Diff view for changes
  - Restore options

**Technical Considerations:**
- Create `TemplateVersion` model
- Implement differential storage to minimize data duplication
- Add API endpoints for version management
- Build UI components for version history and comparison

### 5. Enhanced UI/UX

Improve the template editor with more intuitive controls and better visual representation.

**Implementation Details:**
- Implement drag-and-drop for field positioning:
  - Intuitive field placement
  - Resize handles for fields
  - Alignment guides
- Add undo/redo functionality:
  - Action history tracking
  - Multiple levels of undo/redo
- Enhance preview capabilities:
  - Real-time preview
  - Mobile/tablet view simulation
  - Print preview
- Improve styling options:
  - Field appearance customization
  - Theme selection
  - Custom CSS support (advanced)

**Technical Considerations:**
- Integrate drag-and-drop library (react-dnd or similar)
- Implement state management for undo/redo
- Create responsive preview components
- Add styling controls to field properties

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1-2: Foundation and Categories
- Update data models for all Phase 2 features
- Implement Category model and API endpoints
- Create category management UI
- Update template creation/editing to support categories
- Add category filtering to template listing

### Week 2-3: Advanced Field Types
- Implement data model changes for new field types
- Create UI components for new field types
- Update template editor to support new field configurations
- Enhance document generation to handle new field types

### Week 3-4: Enhanced Permissions
- Create permission model and API endpoints
- Implement permission checking in template APIs
- Build UI for managing template permissions
- Update template sharing flow

### Week 4-5: Template Versioning
- Implement version tracking model
- Create version history API endpoints
- Build version history UI
- Add restore functionality

### Week 5-6: Enhanced UI/UX
- Implement drag-and-drop for fields
- Add undo/redo functionality
- Improve template preview
- Add more styling options
- Final testing and bug fixes

## Milestones

1. **M1**: Category system fully implemented (end of Week 2)
2. **M2**: Advanced field types completed (end of Week 3)
3. **M3**: Enhanced permissions system working (end of Week 4)
4. **M4**: Template versioning implemented (end of Week 5)
5. **M5**: UI enhancements completed and Phase 2 ready for release (end of Week 6)

## Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

### Backward Compatibility
- **Risk**: Changes to field types might break existing templates
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper schema versioning; ensure new field types don't affect existing templates

### Performance with Complex Permissions
- **Risk**: Enhanced permission checks could slow down API responses
- **Mitigation**: Optimize permission queries; consider caching; implement bulk permission checks

### UI Complexity
- **Risk**: Advanced field types and drag-and-drop might complicate the UI
- **Mitigation**: Conduct usability testing; implement progressive disclosure; provide clear documentation

### Data Volume from Versioning
- **Risk**: Template versions could significantly increase database size
- **Mitigation**: Implement differential storage; add version pruning options; optimize database

### Feature Creep
- **Risk**: Scope might expand during implementation
- **Mitigation**: Clearly define Phase 2 boundaries; maintain a prioritized backlog

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for all new models and API endpoints
2. Integration tests for permission systems and template versioning
3. UI component tests for new field types
4. End-to-end tests for critical user flows
5. Performance testing, especially for permission-related queries
6. Browser compatibility testing for advanced UI features

## Future Considerations (Phase 3)

Phase 2 sets the groundwork for more advanced features in Phase 3:

1. AI-assisted template creation and field suggestions
2. Template marketplace with sharing across organizations
3. Advanced analytics and usage insights
4. Workflow integration with approval processes
5. Mobile-optimized templates and responsive design enhancements

## Resources Needed

1. Frontend developers with experience in complex form UI and drag-and-drop
2. Backend developers for data modeling and API optimization
3. UI/UX designer for advanced interface components
4. QA resources for comprehensive testing

## Conclusion

Phase 2 significantly enhances the template system with features focused on organization, collaboration, and advanced functionality. These improvements will transform the basic template feature from Phase 1 into a comprehensive solution for document automation and management.
